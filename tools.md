# Automisering værktøjer
Tools that help us simplify and streamline our code by automating processes. Gulp, for example, runs code through Babel and copmiles it.


## Gulp
https://gulpjs.com

Requires file `gulpfile.js`\
Because node does not interpret ES5 import modules, we use Common JS\
`const gulp = require("gulp");`

Callbacks are ASYNCHRONOUS
Javascript is, by defult, synchronous



## Grunt
https://gruntjs.com


## Babel
https://babeljs.io
